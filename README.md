This is an unfinished puzzle game idea for love2d.

The concept is similar to the "geo panel" color-changing concept from Disgaea. Basically, a board is made up of colored spaces, with some colored pieces (here, floating triangles) placed on the board as well. Pieces can be moved around the board in any direction, and can also be detonated - if a piece is detonated on a tile of a different color, then all tiles of the same color will be changed to the piece's color one at a time, in turn detonating any other pieces on the same color.

The idea behind this version (since it's not part of a larger strategic game like Disgaea) is to change the entire board to a single color in as few moves as possible (either limiting the number of moves on a per-piece basis, or having a single move count for the entire board). 

Currently there is no move limit (and only one non-challenging board) just for testing things. You can cycle through any available pieces and move them around the board freely, and detonate them in any location (on the preset board, try moving either piece one tile to the left or right, then detonate the other one). You can also generate a (not very interesting) random board with random pieces just to test what can be done with more than two colors, although this won't be as interesting as actual human-designed boards, which there should be more (and better) of later on.

I may or may not actually work more on developing this into a real game depending on how interesting the idea actually is.
